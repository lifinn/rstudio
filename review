Hello, this is Bing. I can help you improve your explanation of the plot. Here is my suggestion:

This plot shows how the log odds of weighted default events vary across different bins of raw data. The log odds are calculated as $$\log\left(\frac{p}{1-p}\right)$$, where $$p$$ is the probability of a default event occurring. The raw data is grouped into bins based on the variable `arrsbal_maxL6_`, which represents some form of categorized or binned data. The x-axis shows the mean value of each bin, and the y-axis shows the log odds of weighted default events. Each blue dot on the scatter plot represents the mean value of a bin plotted against its corresponding log odds.

The purple line is derived from a nonparametric lowess model, which employs locally weighted linear regression to provide a smoothed fit to the blue dots, offering insights into underlying trends in the data. The red line represents predicted log odds obtained through weighted least squares regression, which addresses the issue of unequal variance in the residuals by assigning higher weights to observations with lower variance. The green line illustrates how weight percentage varies across different bins, indicating how much weight is assigned to each observation within its respective bin. The plot also shows the percentage volume of weight on the right-hand side of the graph.

I can help you improve your explanation of the second plot as well. Here is my suggestion:

This plot shows how the actual and predicted values of depvar_percent vary across different bins of raw data. The depvar_percent is the default rate of each bin, calculated as the ratio of default events to total events. The raw data is grouped into bins based on the variable `arrsbal_maxL6_`, which represents some form of categorized or binned data. The x-axis shows the mean value of each bin, and the y-axis shows the depvar_percent. The blue line represents the actual data points, plotted against the mean of each bin.

The red line is a prediction made by a weighted least squares model, which addresses the issue of unequal variance in the residuals by assigning higher weights to observations with lower variance. The predicted values are probabilities transformed from the log odds, calculated as $$\frac{e^{\hat{y}}}{1+e^{\hat{y}}}$$, where $$\hat{y}$$ is the predicted log odds. The dotted lines represent the confidence level of this prediction, indicating the range of values that are likely to contain the true value of depvar_percent. The plot also shows the volume of weight on the right-hand side of the graph.

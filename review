In the year-end review, I successfully fulfilled my responsibilities, which included delivering assigned projects and tasks punctually while maintaining a high standard of quality. I actively contributed to the establishment and maintenance of a scalable, well-structured, and controlled technical infrastructure and execution process. A notable achievement was the timely and high-quality delivery of IFRS9 datasets. Additionally, my work involved ensuring that the code was meticulously structured and highly reusable, which further enhanced the efficiency of our technical processes.

In the area of stakeholder management, I have excelled in developing and maintaining strong relationships with individuals and teams across various departments, including QA, Risk, Finance, and the Business. Given my position at the most upstream point of data flow, I recognize all data consumers as stakeholders in our processes.

My role entails interactions with colleagues from diverse organizational structures, ranging from individual contributors to entire teams like the LGD team and IVU. In my interactions with these stakeholders, I have consistently demonstrated a commitment to clear and timely communication, always addressing queries with precision and a service-oriented mindset. This approach has not only fostered effective collaboration but has also underscored my dedication to following through on commitments, thus contributing to a harmonious and efficient work environment.
In the domain of supporting colleague development, I've made significant contributions by focusing on several key areas:

Team Capability Enhancement: I actively participated in building the team's capabilities in achieving rapid, high-quality execution, effective project management, and stakeholder management. This included sharing knowledge and best practices to ensure that our projects were not only delivered promptly but also met high-quality standards.
Personal and Professional Development: I have been committed to supporting the personal and professional growth of all team members. This has been achieved through mentoring, sharing expertise, and providing guidance to help each team member reach their full potential.
Direct Report Leadership: When required, I've taken the lead in the development of my direct reports, helping them acquire the necessary skills and knowledge to excel in their roles.
Knowledge Sharing: I've been actively involved in assisting colleagues with various technical queries related to Spark, Kedro, AWS, Linux systems, and general Python inquiries. Beyond the immediate team, I've extended my support to colleagues outside of our department, such as SMEs working on data creation and HF's migration of their data environments.
AWS Adoption: I've played a pivotal role in the adoption of AWS, ensuring that our team can operate efficiently on the Enterprise Data Platform (EDP). This includes setting up and maintaining a smooth operating environment within AWS.
Transition from SAS to Python and Kedro: I've provided training and guidance to colleagues who previously had expertise in SAS, helping them make a successful transition to Python and Kedro. This has allowed them to quickly become proficient in handling business-as-usual (BAU) tasks.
Through these efforts, I have not only contributed to the growth and effectiveness of our team but have also facilitated knowledge sharing and upskilling of colleagues in a broader context, enabling them to excel in their respective areas of work.

In the pursuit of personal development, I focused on several key areas to enhance my skills and knowledge:

Application of Agile Methodology: I successfully integrated agile methodology into my project and workload management approach. This transition yielded significant results as all critical data creation processes were assigned Jira tickets. This not only clarified decision-making processes but also streamlined data validation, making collaboration with IVU and KPMG more efficient.
Modeling Skills: While I didn't directly engage in the modeling process, I took significant steps to improve my modeling understanding by actively contributing to data preparation for our modelers. My involvement in showcasing an example of a similar function in R for spline cutters further demonstrated my dedication to expanding my modeling knowledge.
Business Knowledge: My commitment to self-improvement extended to the realm of business knowledge, where I actively sought to broaden my understanding. This additional knowledge base has proven invaluable in making informed decisions and contributions to the team.
Data Operation and ETL Skills: I made substantial progress in refining my data operation and ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) skills. A notable achievement was my involvement in the end-to-end design, implementation, and operation of the IFRS9 data warehouse, which further strengthened my expertise in this area.
Spark Proficiency: I made significant strides in mastering Apache Spark, transforming it from a challenging tool into a familiar and easily navigable resource. This newfound proficiency has enhanced my ability to work with data and execute tasks effectively.
Overall, my dedication to personal development has yielded tangible results in various domains, from improving project management methodologies and modeling knowledge to gaining a deeper understanding of business operations and honing data operation and ETL skills. These accomplishments not only contribute to my own growth but also benefit the team and organization as a whole.

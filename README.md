I have taken part in various training to understand the role in the overall banking business. Cash management plays a critical role in modern business, especially for large companies. Because cloud-based computing has been proved as a reliable technique and the on-premise solution has accumulated many problems. Our team start new services, such as Corporate Mobile and Digital Client Payment, and maintain the traditional service, Barclays .Net.
I have also learnt risk and incident management tools, such as service first and Jira to raise and escalate events and issues. 
In the learning process, I have written down the operation process, which provides a way to identify the risk in operation and highlights improving opportunities in the future. It also gives other colleagues a successful way to accomplish tasks and prevent operation risks.
Besides, all the mandatory training has been completed beyond the required standard and before the deadline.

Build a strong relationship with all colleagues and contribute to the team as much as I can. Appreciating other people's work, I have sent thank you card for colleagues who helped me to solve my computer issue.
Ask questions during learning instead of hiding problems and share my understanding with others. Give feedback in many ways after training and learning activities.
Take part in the training that helps me to understand the business behind the technology. Communicate with others in time to understand their needs and provide prompt help.
Be an active member in various training sessions and sharing my knowledge with others who need the information.
Takes into account the ways to improve the work in the future when conducting every piece of work.
